#PICSWAP

This Ruby app allows users to create an account with a username and photo, upload photos and share them with friends, mark photos as favorites, and tag others in photos.

Install the program by cloning it, running bundle, creating a database, and running the migrations. You can also check it out on [Heroku] (http://picswap.herokuapp.com). PICSWAP requires [ImageMagick] (http://www.imagemagick.org/) for photos.
